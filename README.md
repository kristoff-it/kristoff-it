### Hi, I'm Loris! ðŸ‘‹

I'm VP of Community at the [Zig Software Foundation](https://ziglang.org), and the creator and host of [Zig SHOWTIME](https://zig.show)!

You can find opinionated articles on my [personal blog](https://kristoff.it), like "[Why Go and not Rust?](https://kristoff.it/blog/why-go-and-not-rust/)", a fan favorite.

I livecode regularly [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/kristoff_it), and you can also find me shilling & ranting on Twitter [@croloris](https://twitter.com/croloris).

I'm currently sustaining myself through my work for the Zig Software Foundation, but I wouldn't mind one day to become fully independent and focus more on fun stuff, like Zig SHOWTIME and other similar projects.

If you like what I do, consider becoming a GitHub Sponsor to [@ziglang](https://github.com/ziglang) first, and to me second.
