## Hi, I'm Loris! ðŸ‘‹

### Current occupation
VP of Community at the [Zig Software Foundation](https://ziglang.org).
I help Zig grow a vibrant community & ecosystem.

### Social media
- https://twitch.tv/kristoff_it (I stream regularly)
- https://twitter.com/croloris
- https://kristoff.it (personal blog)

### Initiatives
I run the [Zig SHOWTIME YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/ZigSHOWTIME) where I post semi-regularly new videos about Zig.
Zig SHOWTIME is also a livestreamed show, currently on hold because of post-pandemic-online-event-fatigue.

I host [Software You Can Love](https://sycl.it) an in-person conference that 
celebrates the art of creating software for humans ([see the announcement post](https://kristoff.it/blog/sotfware-you-can-love)).

If you like what I do, consider becoming a GitHub Sponsor to [@ziglang](https://github.com/ziglang) first, and to me second.
